# Optimal charging station location on a cycleway

This task is a small project activity for the course "Foundations of Operations Research" held by Prof. Federico Malucelli at Politecnico di Milano in A.Y. 2023-2024.

This project develops a model to optimize the placement of e-bike charging stations along a cycleway. It aims to minimize installation costs while ensuring stations are within a specified maximum distance. The model uses mixed-integer programming to determine optimal locations, considering factors like tourist sites and detours.
